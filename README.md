# Mapping a database row to a Python object : Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Map the values stored in a database row as attributes of a Python object.

## Key Vocab

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: a programming technique that provides a
  mapping between an object-oriented data model and a relational database model.

---

## Introduction

The previous lesson showed how to implement methods to persist (i.e. save) the
attributes of a Python object as a row in a database table.

In this lesson, we see how to map the opposite direction, namely we will map the
values stored in a database table row to the attributes of a Python object. We
will implement the following methods:

| Method                      | Return                                                | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| instance_from_db (cls, row) | object that is an instance of `cls`                   | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values from a table row                                        |
| get_all (cls)               | a list containing objects that are instances of `cls` | Return a list of objects that are instances of the class, assigning the attribute values from each row in a table.                        |
| find_by_id(cls, id))        | object that is an instance of `cls`                   | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values using the table row specified by the primary key `id`   |
| find_by_name(cls, name)     | object that is an instance of `cls`                   | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values using the first table row matching the specified `name` |

## Code Along

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

**NOTE: Remember to run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and
`pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment before running your code.**

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Let's continue building out the `Department` class and its object-relational
mapping methods from the previous lesson. The starter code for the `Department`
class is in `lib/department.py`.

We need to build a few methods to access one or more table rows and return
Python objects with attribute values that match the row data.

To start, review the code from the `Department` class. Then take a look at this
code in the `debug.py` file:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from __init__ import CONN, CURSOR
from department import Department

import ipdb


def reset_database():
    Department.drop_table()
    Department.create_table()

    Department.create("Payroll", "Building A, 5th Floor")
    Department.create("Human Resources", "Building C, East Wing")
    Department.create("Accounting", "Building B, 1st Floor")


reset_database()
ipdb.set_trace()

```

This file is set up so that you can explore the database using the `Department`
class from an `ipdb` session. The file recreates the `Department` table and
persists a few objects into the table.

Run `debug.py` to confirm the code is able to reset and initialize the table:

```bash
python lib/debug.py
```

Then type the following statements (one at a time) at the `ipdb>` prompt to
confirm the table rows:

```py
ipdb> departments = CURSOR.execute('SELECT * FROM departments')
ipdb> [row for row in departments]
# => [(1, 'Payroll', 'Building A, 5th Floor'), (2, 'Human Resources', 'Building C, East Wing'), (3, 'Accounting', 'Building B, 1st Floor')]
```

You can also use SQLITE EXPLORER to confirm the table content.

## Maintaining a dictionary of objects persisted to the database

Several of the methods we write in this lesson will query the "departments"
table and return a department object whose attributes are assigned to the row
data. However, consider what happens if we query the table several times for the
same table row. For example, we may have 10 employees working for the same
department. Within our Python application, we will have 10 employee objects that
should all be associated with the same department object. It is important that
we avoid creating duplicate department objects when mapping from the same
"departments" table row.

To solve this, we will cache (i.e. store) each department object that has been
persisted to the database. We'll use a dictionary data structure, where each
entry consists of a **key** and a **value**:

- the **key** is the `id` of the Python object that was saved to the database
  (i.e. an instance of the `Department` class).
- the **value** is the actual Python object that was saved to the database.

In later lessons we will use an ORM framework named **FLASK-SQLALCHEMY**, which
manages the mapping between table rows and Python objects, and alleviates the
need to explicitly maintain a dictionary in our code.

Let's update the `Department` class to add a class variable named `all` that
references a dictionary to store each `Department` object that has been saved to
the database.

```py
from __init__ import CURSOR, CONN


class Department:

    # Dictionary of objects saved to the database.
    all = {}

    # existing methods ...
```

We'll also update the `save()` method to add the current `Department` instance
to the dictionary, using the row's primary key as the dictionary key. This is
done by adding the statement `type(self).all[self.id] = self` to the end of the
method:

```py
    def save(self):
        """ Insert a new row with the name and location values of the current Department instance.
        Update object id attribute using the primary key value of new row.
        Save the object in local dictionary using table row's PK as dictionary key"""
        sql = """
            INSERT INTO departments (name, location)
            VALUES (?, ?)
        """

        CURSOR.execute(sql, (self.name, self.location))
        CONN.commit()

        self.id = CURSOR.lastrowid
        type(self).all[self.id] = self
```

NOTE: `type(self)` will evaluate to the `Department` class.

Now we can implement the necessary methods for mapping table rows to Python
objects.

## `instance_from_db()`

| Method                      | Return                              | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| instance_from_db (cls, row) | object that is an instance of `cls` | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values from a table row |

This method will map the data stored in a "deparments" table row into an
instance of `Department`.

One thing to know is that the database, SQLite in our case, will return a list
of data for each row. For example, a row for the payroll department would look
like this: `[1, "Payroll", "Building A, 5th Floor"]`. We use `row[0]` to get the
department id `1`, `row[1]` to get the department name `"Payroll"`, etc.

Add the new class method `instance_from_db(cls, row)` to the `Department` class:

```py
    @classmethod
    def instance_from_db(cls, row):
        """Return a Department object having the attribute values from the table row."""

        # Check the dictionary for an existing instance using the row's primary key
        department = cls.all.get(row[0])
        if department:
            # ensure attributes match row values in case local object was modified
            department.name = row[1]
            department.location = row[2]
        else:
            # not in dictionary, create new instance and add to dictionary
            department = cls(row[1], row[2])
            department.id = row[0]
            cls.all[department.id] = department
        return department
```

The `instance_from_db` method takes a reference to a Python class `cls` and a
list named `row` that stores the column values from a table row. The method
looks in the dictionary for an existing object using the primary key `id` as the
dictionary key, and updates the attribute values to match the row data. However,
it is possible that the database table may contain a row that does not
correspond to a dictionary entry, in which case the method creates a new object
and adds it to the dictionary.

Type `exit()` to terminate the debugging session, then rerun
`python lib/debug.py` to create the table with initial values. We can list the
dictionary of persisted objects:

```py
ipdb> Department.all
{1: <Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>, 2: <Department 2: Human Resources, Building C, East Wing>, 3: <Department 3: Accounting, Building B, 1st Floor>}
```

Execute a query to get a row of data, then use that row to get a Python
Department object (type each statement one at a time at the prompt `ipdb>`):

```py
ipdb> row = CURSOR.execute("select * from departments").fetchone()
ipdb> row
(1, 'Payroll', 'Building A, 5th Floor')
ipdb> department = Department.instance_from_db(row)
ipdb> department
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
ipdb>
```

---

## `get_all()`

| Method        | Return                                                | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| get_all (cls) | a list containing objects that are instances of `cls` | Return a list of objects that are instances of the class, assigning the attribute values from each row in a table. |

To return all the departments in the database, we need to do the following:

1. define a SQL query statement to select all rows from the table
2. use the CURSOR to execute the query, and then call the `fetchall()` method on
   the query result to return the rows sequentially in a tuple.
3. iterate over each row and call `instance_from_db()` with each row in the
   query result to retrieve a Python object from the row data:

Add the new class method `get_all()` to the `Department` class:

```py
    @classmethod
    def get_all(cls):
        """Return a list containing a Department object per row in the table"""
        sql = """
            SELECT *
            FROM departments
        """

        rows = CURSOR.execute(sql).fetchall()

        return [cls.instance_from_db(row) for row in rows]
```

With this method in place, let's try calling the `get_all()` method to access
all the departments in the database.

Exit `ipdb` and run python
` lib/debug.py`` again and follow along in the  `ipdb` session:

```py
ipdb> Department.get_all()
[<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>, <Department 2: Human Resources, Building C, East Wing>, <Department 3: Accounting, Building B, 1st Floor>]
ipdb>
```

Success! We can see all three departments in the database as a list of
`Department` instances. We can interact with them just like any other Python
objects:

```py
ipdb> departments = Department.get_all()
ipdb> departments[0]
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
ipdb> departments[0].name
'Payroll'
ipdb>
```

## `find_by_id()`

| Method               | Return                              | Description                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| find_by_id(cls, id)) | object that is an instance of `cls` | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values using the table row specified by the primary key `id` |

This one is similar to `get_all()`, with the small exception being that we have
a `WHERE` clause to test the `id` in our SQL statement. To do this, we use a
bound parameter (i.e. question mark) where we want the `id` parameter to be
passed in, and we include `id` in a tuple as the second argument to the
`execute()` method:

```py
    @classmethod
    def find_by_id(cls, id):
        """Return a Department object corresponding to the table row matching the specified primary key"""
        sql = """
            SELECT *
            FROM departments
            WHERE id = ?
        """

        row = CURSOR.execute(sql, (id,)).fetchone()
        return cls.instance_from_db(row) if row else None

```

There are a couple important things to note here:

- Bound parameters must be passed to the `execute` statement as a sequence data
  type. This is typically performed with tuples to match the format that results
  are returned in. A tuple containing only one element must have a comma after
  that element, otherwise it is interpreted as a grouped statement (think
  [PEMDAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations)).
- The `fetchone()` method returns the first element from `fetchall()`.

Let's try out this new method. Exit `ipdb` and run `python lib/debug.py` again:

```py
ipdb> department = Department.find_by_id(1)
ipdb> department
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
ipdb> department.name
'Payroll'
ipdb> department.location
'Building A, 5th Floor'
ipdb>
```

## `find_by_name()`

| Method                  | Return                              | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| find_by_name(cls, name) | object that is an instance of `cls` | Return an object that is an instance of the class, assigning the attribute values using the first table row matching the specified `name` |

The `find_by_name()` method is similar to `find_by_id()`, but we will limit the
result to the first row matching the specified name.

```py
    @classmethod
    def find_by_name(cls, name):
        """Return a Department object corresponding to first table row matching specified name"""
        sql = """
            SELECT *
            FROM departments
            WHERE name is ?
        """

        row = CURSOR.execute(sql, (name,)).fetchone()
        return cls.instance_from_db(row) if row else None

```

Let's try out this new method. Exit `ipdb` and run `python lib/debug.py` again:

```py
ipdb> department = Department.find_by_name("Payroll")
ipdb> department
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>

```

## Update the `delete` method to remove the dictionary entry

The `delete` method deletes the table row corresponding to the current
Department instance. To ensure the Python object model reflects the table data,
the `delete` method should also remove the corresponding key/value pair from the
dictionary, and assign the instance `id` attribute back to `None`.

Update the `delete` method as shown:

```py
def delete(self):
        """Delete the table row corresponding to the current Department instance,
        delete the dictionary entry, and reassign id attribute"""


        sql = """
            DELETE FROM departments
            WHERE id = ?
        """

        CURSOR.execute(sql, (self.id,))
        CONN.commit()

        # Delete the dictionary entry using id as the key
        del type(self).all[self.id]

        # Set the id to None
        self.id = None
```

Success!

### Testing the ORM

The `testing` folder contains the file `department_orm_test.py`, which has been
updated to test all of the ORM methods.

Run `pytest -x` to confirm your code passes the tests, then submit this
code-along assignment using `git`.

> **Note: You may have to delete your existing database `company.db` for all of
> the tests to pass- SQLite sometimes "locks" databases that have been accessed
> by multiple modules.**

## Conclusion

In the previous lesson, we have created a database and persisted Python objects
to the database. In this lesson, we saw how to map data stored in the database
into Python objects. We cached Python objects using a dictionary to ensure a row
maps to the same Python object each time it is retrieved using a query.
Eventually, we will learn how to use an ORM framework that manages this mapping
for us.

We haven't covered every use case, but we have a functioning ORM for a single
Python class!

In the next lesson, we will see how to persist relationships between Python
class instances.
